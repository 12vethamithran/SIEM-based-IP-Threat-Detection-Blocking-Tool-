bashpython SIEM_Tool.py
üîß Configuration Guide
Trusted IP Management
Protect critical infrastructure by adding IPs to the whitelist:
pythontrusted_ips = [
    "192.168.1.1",      # Gateway
    "192.168.0.100",    # Domain Controller
    "10.0.0.1",         # Management Interface
    "your.server.ip"    # Your servers
]
Threat Detection Thresholds
Customize detection sensitivity:
python# Adjust these values based on your security requirements
if abuse_confidence_score > 90 or \    # High confidence threats
   num_reports > 1 or \                # Multiple abuse reports
   num_distinct_users > 2 or \         # Multiple reporters
   is_tor:                             # Tor network detection
Log File Format Support
The tool automatically detects IP addresses in various log formats:

Apache/Nginx Access Logs
Windows Event Logs
Firewall Logs
Custom Application Logs
Plain Text IP Lists

üíª Usage Examples
Basic Threat Scanning
python# Single IP check
ip = "suspicious.ip.address"
if is_malicious(ip):
    block_ip(ip)
Batch Processing from Logs
python# Process entire log file
log_file = "path/to/security.log"
extracted_ips = extract_ips(log_file)
for ip in extracted_ips:
    if is_malicious(ip):
        block_ip(ip)
Manual IP Analysis
bash# Run interactive mode
python SIEM_Tool.py

# Output example:
Checking IP: 185.220.101.5
IP 185.220.101.5 is malicious. Taking action!
Blocked IP: 185.220.101.5 due to: Abuse confidence score > 90
üìä Sample Output
Console Output
Extracted IPs: {'109.70.100.2', '198.98.51.189', '185.220.101.5', '192.42.116.175'}
Checking IP: 109.70.100.2
IP 109.70.100.2 is malicious. Taking action!
Blocked IP: 109.70.100.2 due to: Abuse confidence score > 90

Kibana - For visualization and dashboards

Real-Time Monitoring Setup
bash# Set up automated monitoring (Windows Task Scheduler)
# Run every 5 minutes for continuous protection
schtasks /create /tn "SIEM-IP-Monitor" /tr "python C:\path\to\SIEM_Tool.py" /sc minute /mo 5
‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration
Custom Blocking Actions

    # Multiple blocking methods
    windows_firewall_block(ip)
    router_blacklist(ip)
    siem_alert(ip)
    email_notification(ip)
API Rate Limit Management
python# AbuseIPDB free tier: 1000 requests/day
# Implement rate limiting for production use
import time

def rate_limited_check(ip):
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Prevent API flooding
    return is_malicious(ip)
üìà Performance Metrics

Processing Speed: ~100 IPs per minute
API Response Time: <200ms average

export ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Network Security

Uses HTTPS for all API communications
Validates SSL certificates
Implements request timeout protection
