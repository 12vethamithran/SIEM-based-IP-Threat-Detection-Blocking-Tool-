    NETWORK LOG FILES - IP COLLECTION
=====================================

üìã FILE PURPOSE
---------------
This file contains raw IP addresses extracted from various network sources including:
‚Ä¢ Firewall logs
‚Ä¢ Access logs 
‚Ä¢ Security event logs
‚Ä¢ Network monitoring systems
‚Ä¢ SIEM platform exports

üéØ DATA SOURCE
--------------
These IP addresses represent actual network traffic that has been flagged for 
security analysis. The IPs are collected from live network environments and 
require threat intelligence validation to determine their malicious nature.

üìä EXPECTED CONTENT FORMAT
--------------------------
‚Ä¢ Plain text IP addresses (IPv4 format)
‚Ä¢ One IP per line or extracted from log entries
‚Ä¢ Mixed legitimate and potentially malicious addresses
‚Ä¢ No pre-filtering applied - raw data for analysis

üîç ANALYSIS WORKFLOW
--------------------
1. IP addresses are extracted using regex pattern matching
2. Each IP is queried against AbuseIPDB threat intelligence
3. Threat scoring and classification is performed
4. Malicious IPs are identified and blocked automatically
5. Results are logged in the threat detection report

‚ö†Ô∏è  DATA HANDLING NOTES
-----------------------
‚Ä¢ Contains potentially sensitive network information
‚Ä¢ IPs may include internal and external addresses  
‚Ä¢ Should be processed in secure environment only
‚Ä¢ Regular cleanup recommended for privacy compliance

üîß INTEGRATION USAGE
--------------------
This file serves as the INPUT for the SIEM IP Threat Detection Tool:
- Feed directly into SIEM_Tool.py for automated processing
- Compatible with batch analysis workflows
- Supports continuous monitoring pipelines
